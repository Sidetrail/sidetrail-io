<div>
    <p>This is a demo post showing the features and capabilites of the blog posts on this website, as well as a brief overview of how they work</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    
    
    <h3>Formatting and Markdown</h3>
    <p>Each post is written in as a HTML file and supports the styling and formatting that is supported by modern HTML, for example </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>
            <p>Code blocks</p>
            <pre>
                <code style="background-color: #999;
                margin: 0;
                display: block;
                padding: 5px;">
const sum =  (x, y) => {
    return x+y;
}
                </code>
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Images</p>
            <img height="200px" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Beeo55.jpg"></img>
        </li>
        <li>And more!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Embedded Code</h3>
    <p>Using JSFiddle, I can embed runable code into the blog post itself</p>
    <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/enw5rcdx/embedded/js,html,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Each blog post is just an HTML file dynamically loaded from the public folder of the deployed application. The react code makes a request based on the URL for a HTML file and then sets the innerHTML to the payload</p>
    <p>There is an index file that is fetched that contains the list of all blog posts and some summary information about them, below is an example payload containing a single blog post.</p>
    <pre>
        <code style="background-color: #999;
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0;
        display: block;
        padding: 5px;">
[
    {
        "id":"1",
        "title": "Demo Post",
        "headerImage":"/blog/header1.jpg",
        "tags":["test", "demo", "website"],
        "originalPostDate": "2021-07-13T17:53:36.315Z",
        "lastUpdatedDate": "2022-02-11T17:17:14.102Z",
        "summary": "This is a test post intended to prototype blogs.",
        "url":"test_post"
    }
]
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This index file is the basis for blog landing page, and drives the functionality behind the tags, searching, and filtering as well. Each entry contains the high level information about the blog post and some meta-data</p>
    <p>The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Sidetrail/sidetrail-io">here</a></p>
